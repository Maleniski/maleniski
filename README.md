### üëã Hello! I'm Mar√≠a Elena Mart√≠nez Manzanares, a.k.a. Malena Manzanares

I'm a mathematician and data scientist with a passion for stochastic control processes, Markov processes, and the intersection of mathematics and data science. I hold a PhD in Mathematics, and my academic journey includes:

- **PhD in Mathematics (2024)**
- **Master's Degree in Mathematics (2020)**
- **Master's Degree in Data Science (2024)**
- **Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics (2018)**
- **Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics Education (2023)**

Currently, I work as an AI Developer, and my research experience expands to probability, stochastic control processes, Markov processes, NLP, and teaching and learning processes of statistics at the university level.

### üåü Featured Projects

- **[SemiMarkov-MeanField](https://github.com/Maleniski/SemiMarkov-MeanField):** A repository showcasing a board that demonstrates part of my doctoral work related to semi-Markov control processes and mean-field theory.

- **[Empirical-JobModel-HLP](https://github.com/Maleniski/Empirical-JobModel-HLP):** This project focuses on developing a model to calculate the affinity between candidates and job descriptions, specifically in the fields of data science and software development in the Mexican context. The related article is published in *Applied Artificial Intelligence* [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08839514.2024.2364158).

- **[LLM Content Collection](https://github.com/mcd-unison/llm):** A collaborative project with the University of Sonora to collect educational content ralted to Large Language Models.

- **[Diccionario de Anglicismos y Tecnicismos en M√©xico](https://github.com/Maleniski/diccionario-angl-tec-mx):** A structured dictionary compiling anglicisms and technical terms commonly used in software and data science in Mexico. This resource aims to help newcomers in these fields become familiar with terms that might be unfamiliar at the start of their careers.
